                        When visiting this web page from a mobile device, it will prompt the user to provide their location using a standard
                        browser geolocation API. This location data is then cross-referenced against active <a href="https://weather.gov" target="_blank">US National Weather Service</a>
                        severe weather alerts. The majority of these alerts since 2007 have been outlined based on geographic polygons rather than
                        political subdivisions or county-equivalents. The user is then informed whether their device's reported location is 
                        inside one of these warning polygons. If so, links are shown to a companion web app running at <a href="https://map.wx4.me/" target="_blank">map.wx4.me</a>.

                        &ldquo;Respect the Polygon&rdquo; is a phrase popularized by legendary Alabama television meteorologist James Spann. 
                        It is meant to remind his audience that forecasters at the National Weather Service are experts in their field, and 
                        if a given location is inside one of these storm-based warning polygons, there is a very good reason for it. Anyone 
                        inside the warning polygon should take action to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their property from 
                        natural hazards. This app is my effort to help people quickly determine whether they should take these actions.
